# TODO

## Remove unnecessary files in `docs/`

* `guidebooks` folder is OK
* `notes_ABC` folder is OK
* `scripts` folder is OK
* `notes_BENGI` folder is OK
* `haemochromatosis` folder is almost OK (see below)

The others remain TODO:
* `data_and_results` folder
* `haemochromatosis` folder is OK when it comes to markdown (100% OK) BUT it contains a lot of results/data, which would better be in `data_and_results` folder, so I have to move them there

## Add new files

TODO:

* All scripts used throughout the guidelines should be available in `docs/scripts`
