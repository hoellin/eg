See `format_donnees.md` to understand how `merged_inferred_genes_v1.list` and `merged_inferred_genes_v1.csv` are computed.

Please remark that I completed missing gene ids in `merged_inferred_genes_v1.csv` by hand, whereas I left them untouched in `merged_inferred_genes_v1.list`.

Why are there missing ids? Because no ENSEMBL ids were given in [[Nasser 2021]] ABC data.
