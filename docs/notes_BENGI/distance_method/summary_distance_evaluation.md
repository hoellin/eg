# Evaluation of Distance method over the 6 BENGI for GM12878

We ran Moore et al' implementation (with some necessary modifications) of the Distance method over the 6 BENGI for GM12878, to ensure we find the same results (so that we can make comparisons with further tests). See detailed procedure [here](distance_evaluation_with_code.html).

We obtained the following Precision - Recall and AUPR, which are, indeed, the same as in Moore et al' paper & supplementary figures.
