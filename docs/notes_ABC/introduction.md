These pages gather guidelines to run Fulco et al' ABC model over several examples (chr22, K562, GM12878, GM12878 with accessions from Moore et al' BENGI, ...). 

For some of them, the code can be directly adapted on your computer to re-run the steps, if needed. For some others, one should use the dedicated notebook, or start from & adapt the generic notebook. All notebooks can be found at [http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/~thoellinger/notebooks/ipynb/ABC/](http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/~thoellinger/notebooks/ipynb/ABC/).
