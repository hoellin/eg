General remark: these markdown contain mistakes in the guidelines that led to errors at some steps, for comparison purposes if these errors occur again in the future. Hence, one should better refer to the guidelines available in the dedicated section on my Genoweb page: http://genoweb.toulouse.inra.fr/~thoellinger/notes/notes_BENGI/introduction.html.
