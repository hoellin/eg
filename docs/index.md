# How to navigate through these pages

These pages were first intented for my personal use to organize my notes, and to share them with my colleagues. Now they could be used as guidelines to help going through the data and scripts used to reproduce the results presented in the [paper](...) paper. Yet as they were not intented to be read by another audience, they are not very user-friendly. If you have any question or suggestion, please do not hesitate to [contact me](../../about_me).
